## BuildTheEarth

Join us in this massive project as we recreate the Earth in Minecraft, in 1:1 scale, one block at a time. [**Discord Server**](https://discord.gg/QEkPmBy)

## Bot

This bot is used both in the main Build The Earth server and in the staff server. It's filled with features useful for both of these, including moderation and management commands, suggestions, and utilities exclusive to our project operations.

You shouldn't use this bot on your own servers as it's heavily customized for our needs. Running the bot is not supported (unless you're planning on contributing!).

## Rewrite

This project originated as a complete rewrite of our old bot, an extension of the **[AlphaConsole bot](https://github.com/AlphaConsole/AlphaConsoleBot/)**.

As the old code was entirely unmaintainable and riddled with bugs, we decided that a whole rewrite was the best option.

## Development

-   The bot is written in **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript;
-   It uses **[discord.js](http://discord.js.org/)** for interacting with Discord's API;
-   **[TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/)** for objectâ€“relational mapping;
-   And it follows object-oriented and modularization principles.
-   For version control, it follows a superset of the **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)** specification.
